# 🖼️ Image Processing Filters (C++ Project)

Welcome to the **Image Processing Filters** project!  
This is a C++ application that allows users to apply **12 different image processing filters** to an image via a menu-based interface.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Grayscale conversion  
- Black & White filter  
- Invert colors  
- Merge two images  
- Flipping (Horizontal & Vertical)  
- Rotation (90°, 180°, 270°)  
- Lighten / Darken (adjust brightness)  
- Crop image  
- Add white frame (with style: simple or dotted)  
- Box Blur (variable blur level)  
- Edge detection  
- Resize image (custom width & height)  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program loads an image file (such as `.bmp`, `.jpg`, or `.png`).  
2. The user is presented with a menu of 12 filters.  
3. The user selects the desired filter and optionally provides parameters (e.g., blur level, crop size, frame thickness).  
4. The filter is applied to the image, and the user can choose to save the resulting image under a new filename.

## 🧩 Technologies & Concepts Used
- **C++** programming  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) and data structures (via your `Image_Class.h`)  
- Pixel manipulation and image processing algorithms  
- Use of external libraries for image loading/saving (`stb_image.h` & `stb_image_write.h`)  
- Modular programming and function decomposition

## ✅ What I Learned
By building this project, I enhanced my ability to:  
- Access and modify raw pixel data in images  
- Implement classic image processing operations via nested loops  
- Apply object-oriented design for image handling  
- Handle user input robustly and allow for saving results  
- Explore further potential features for image applications

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Develop a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** version (possibly with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) or Qt)  
- Support for additional image formats and color spaces  
- Add more advanced filters (e.g., Gaussian blur, sepia tone, histogram equalization)  
- Convert project into a full-stack web or mobile application to showcase both frontend (Flutter) and backend
